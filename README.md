This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Littlesea Caravan Website

I built this website for a client using Next.Js and Tailwind, with responsiveness and accessibility in mind. The site is used to showcase a holiday home that can be rented via Airbnb. During the design process, I worked closely with the client to ensure their requirements were met and they were satisfied with the end product. 

The following npm packages were used in the development of the site: 

- Next: This framework enables server-side rendering of pages with React.
- React and React-dom: Both of these packages are used for building user interfaces. 
- React-Icons: This package allows for easy integration of icons into the website. 

To install the project, use the command `npm i`. 

To run the project, use the command `npm start`.
